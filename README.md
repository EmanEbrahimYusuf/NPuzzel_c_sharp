# NPuzzle  by multible search algorithe A star , BFS and DFS
## useing in this algorithmes 
* A* algorithme in AStare File
* BFS algorithme in BFS file 
* DFS algorithme in DFS file  
## this project expected to solve N puzzle in shortest time
### there is folder (" Test cases ") this folder contain diffrent test cases of puzzle 
increasing from easy to hareder 
### the language used in this project is c sharp
